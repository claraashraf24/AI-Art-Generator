# AI-Art-Generator
This project implements Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate realistic images using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is trained to generate images across 10 classes, such as planes and animals, showcasing the potential of AI in creative image generation through deep learning.

ðŸ§  Project Highlights
Model: Custom-built GAN architecture with separate generator and discriminator networks that compete against each other in a creative adversarial process.
Dataset: Utilizes the popular CIFAR-10 dataset (60,000 32x32 color images, across 10 classes) for training. The model learns to generate images that resemble airplanes, cars, cats, and more from this dataset.
Innovation: This project transforms the small-scale CIFAR-10 images into vivid AI art. The generator network learns to create new, photo-realistic images, while the discriminator tries to distinguish real images from the generated ones.
Training Process: Training involves thousands of iterations where the generator becomes increasingly skilled at "fooling" the discriminator, resulting in progressively more realistic images.
Visualization: Track the evolution of generated images with saved outputs after each epoch, showcasing the gradual improvement of the GAN over timeâ€”from noise to structured, coherent images.
ðŸš€ Key Features
Creative Machine Learning: An innovative application of GANs for creative AI art generation using deep learning techniques.
State-of-the-Art Technology: Built with TensorFlow and Keras, this project explores advanced AI concepts in a hands-on, practical way.
Fully Configurable: Customize various aspects of the GAN, from network architecture to training hyperparameters, and experiment with different settings to push the limits of AI-generated art.
Easy-to-Run: With clearly structured code and detailed documentation, anyone can clone this repository, train the model, and witness the evolution of AI-generated art.
ðŸ“Š Results
The generator model starts with random noise and, after training, generates visually coherent images resembling real-world objects. Initial outputs may look abstract or chaotic, but as training progresses, the generated images gradually resemble the CIFAR-10 categories with increasing detail and precision.

ðŸŽ¯ Future Enhancements
Experimenting with different GAN architectures like DCGAN or StyleGAN for better image quality and faster convergence.
Extending the model to create artistic style transfer between images or even AI-generated art based on music.
Exploring the possibility of using larger datasets for higher-resolution outputs.
